>This book is designed as a text for an undergraduate course in signals and system.
>While such courses a frequently found in electrical engineering curricula, the concepts and techniques that form the core of the subject are of fundamental importance in all engineering discipline. In fact the scope of potential and actual application of the methods of signal and system analysis continues to expand as enginners are confonted with new challenges involving the synthesis of analysis of complex processe. For these reason we fill that a course in signals and systems can be one of the most rewarding, exciting, and useful courses that engineering students take during their undergraduate education.
